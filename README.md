## 📊 Student Performance Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to analyze and predict student performance using a Multiple Linear Regression model. The dataset includes various factors such as hours of study, sleep time, extracurricular activities, and more, to predict a student's performance index.

## 🚀 Project Overview:

Goal: To build a regression model that predicts a student's performance index based on multiple features.

Dataset: Student_Performance.csv (from Kaggle).

# Key Steps:

->Data preprocessing and feature engineering.

->Correlation analysis to select highly influential features.

->Scaling features using MinMaxScaler.

->Splitting dataset into training and testing sets.

->Training a Linear Regression model.

->Evaluating the model with R2 Score and Mean Absolute Error.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used:

1)Python 🐍

2)pandas

3)numpy

4)scikit-learn

5)matplotlib

6)seaborn

## 📈 Results:

->R² Score: Measures how well the model fits the data.

->Mean Absolute Error: Evaluates the average error in predictions.

## 💡 Insights:

Visualizations and correlation heatmaps revealed which features have the strongest relationship with the performance index, helping to build a more accurate model.
